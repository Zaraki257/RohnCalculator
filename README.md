# RohnCalculator

This is my first app on github.

App is Simple calculator which does basic operations add, subtract, multiply & divide.

This app uses DataBinding and Contraint layout. 

I learnt to make this app from android authority tutorial which you can easily find it.

More things to edit in future.

**_Update 1.0_**
> Removed Titlebar for more space to textview.

> Updated the whole view with new version of Constraint Layout 1.1.

> Added barriers and chains for more userfriendly and multiple size screen compatibility.

> Updated minSdk to 19(previous was 15) and comipleSdk and targetSdk to 27(previous was 25).

> Changed all hardcoded string value into their respective strings folder.

> Changed Orientation to fix potrait mode(will change it in future :wink:).

> Added AutoScaling textview feature to input Text and results.

> Much Cleaner git repository than previous ones

_more updates comming soon._


# Things needed to done in future :  
> TextView should not show +,-,*,/ and = any of this symbols and answer should be plain simple like real calculator.

> If any operation is performed without putting digits then it need to do by 0 or else show toast message to input no.

> '=' button pressed repeatdely should not show additional answer or NaN.

> ~~Most Imp : edit textview should have autoscaling text view as of in real calculaor.~~

> Add more functions.

Hope This Code helps you.:blush:
