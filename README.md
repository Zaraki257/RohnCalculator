# RohnCalculator

This is my first app on github.

App is Simple calculator which does basic operations add, subtract, multiply & divide.

This app uses DataBinding and Contraint layout. 

I learnt to make this app from android authority tutorial which you can easily find it.

More things to edit in future.

# Things needed to done in future :  
1 TextView should not show +,-,*,/ and = any of this symbols and answer should be plain simple like real calculator.

2 If any operation is performed without putting digits then it need to do by 0 or else show toast message to input no.

3 '=' button pressed repeatdely should not show additional answer or NaN.

4 Most Imp : edit textview should have autoscaling text view as of in real calculaor.

5 Add more functions.

Hope This Code helps you.
